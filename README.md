ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ SQL Project
This project simulates a digital library environment using SQL. It covers essential database operations, from basic CRUD tasks to advanced queries for analysis and reporting. The aim is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to manage and extract insights from library data.

ðŸ§© Database Schema Overview
The database consists of several interconnected tables:

Books â€“ Stores details about books in the library.

Members â€“ Contains information about registered library members.

Employees â€“ Holds data about library staff.

Branch â€“ Represents different branches of the library.

Issue Status â€“ Records the issue details of books.

Return Status â€“ Tracks returned books.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives & Tasks
âœ… Task 1: CRUD Operations
Create: Add new book records to the library database.

Read: Retrieve relevant information from tables such as issued books or member details.

Update: Modify existing data, such as updating a memberâ€™s address.

Delete: Remove records, for example, deleting an issue record no longer needed.

âœ… Task 2: Query-Based Analysis
Book Issues by Employee: View all books issued by a specific employee.

Frequent Issuers: Identify members who have issued more than one book.

Overdue Books: Detect members who haven't returned books within a 30-day period.

Update Book Status: Change a book's status to "available" once returned.

âœ… Task 3: CTAS and Reporting
Summary Tables: Create new tables summarizing total books issued per title.

Branch Report: Generate branch-wise reports showing issues, returns, and revenue.

Active Members Table: Use CTAS to build a table of members active in the last 2 months.

âœ… Key Learnings
Hands-on experience with real-world SQL use cases.

Practice with CTAS, subqueries, aggregate functions, and JOIN operations.

Structured query development and database design.
